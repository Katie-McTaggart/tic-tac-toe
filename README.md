This is a 2 player Tic Tac Toe game. 

The game checks 4 different win outcomes:
a) any row
b) any column
c) diagonal from the top left
d) diagonal from the top right

There is the potential to change this program into one which allows any size of board. Some slight modifications would just need to be made to the as this current form uses a 2D array of chars to represent the board.
